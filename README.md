## Project Overview
This project is a **Drag-and-Drop Website Builder** built as a prototype to transform the traditional form-based website creation experience into an intuitive and interactive interface.

## Objective
The goal was to develop a **drag-and-drop interface** that allows users to:
- Drag and position components (text, images, buttons) on a canvas.
- Edit each element's properties using form-based inputs.
- Maintain responsive design for different screen sizes.

## Features
- **Live Element Property Editing** via forms (text content, color, etc.)
- **Responsive Design** ‚Äì Works well on desktop and mobile
- Built using **React** and **Vite** for a fast and modern development setup
