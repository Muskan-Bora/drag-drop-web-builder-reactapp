## Project Overview
This prototype implements a click-to-add interface inspired by the drag-and-drop concept. Users can add elements (Text, Image, Button) to a canvas by clicking them in the sidebar. Once on the canvas, clicking an element opens a configuration panel to modify its properties via form inputs.

This approach maintains the original form-based logic of the platform while introducing an interactive layout-building experience.

## Objective
The goal was to develop a **drag-and-drop interface** that allows users to:
- click-to-add components (text, images, buttons) on a canvas.
- Provide a form-based configuration panel for editing each element's properties.
- Maintain responsive design for different screen sizes.

## Features
 - Click-to-Add Elements (Text, Image, Button)
 - Form-Based Configuration Panel for each selected element
 - Responsive Design across desktop and mobile
 - Reusable Components and clean code structure

## Key Focus Areas
1. User Experience
Smooth and intuitive interaction
Easy to add and configure components

2. Customization
Sidebar form allows text, image, and button edits

3. Responsiveness
Layout adjusts across screen sizes using custom CSS

4. Scalability
Ready for future enhancements (drag-and-drop, more templates)

5. Code Quality
Clean structure, reusable components, and clear naming

----
Conclusion
This mini project demonstrates how a form-based builder can evolve into an interactive interface using modern React practices. While it currently uses click-to-add, it‚Äôs built with extensibility in mind, making it easy to integrate full drag-and-drop support in the future.
